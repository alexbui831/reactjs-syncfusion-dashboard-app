# NOTES BY ALEXANDER BUI ABOUT THIS DASHBOARD PROJECT

# AUG 25

The importance of creating an app with correct file structure allows easier management throughout the whole coding process

# AUG 26

There was an error code:
'Line' is not defined react/jsx-no-undef
'Editor' is not defined react/jsx-no-undef
I fixed it by looking through the components first but couldn't find anything, then I realized it must be something with the imports and fixed it by adding 'Line' and 'Editor" in the imports

# AUG 27

An issue when I had the activeMenu = 'true', the Navbar would still be opened. It was due to a '$' character I thought I had to use before an '{activeMenu}' call in my ` string

# AUG 28

A contextProvider is used to pass data data through a component tree without having to manually pass props,
JSX does not allow class=, u need className=

# SEPT 1

Syncfusion is really useful for creating data tables, makes adding functionalities way easier
Issue with deconstructing a color value realizing it did not need any deconstructing due to it already being a string
